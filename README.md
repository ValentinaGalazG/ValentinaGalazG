🌊🐚I'm Marine Biologist from the Andrés Bello University. Currently, I'm studying the PhD program of Biological Sciences, mention in Ecology, in the Pontifical Catoholic University of Chile.

🔭🧠 I'm very interested in physical oceanography, climate change and Earth and planetary sciences 🌍✨.

🦦 The love of my life is my pretty little baby (🎶), ¡Buñuelo! (a ferret 𖹭).

🎮 I usually spend my free time gaming shooters: Valorant, Pubg, Apex, etc :). (Ah, and I like to play League of Legends too 😭, unfortunately 💔).

📫 You can find me as "Valentina Antonella Galaz" in LinkedIn, and "Valentina A. Galaz-Guajardo" in ResearchGate.
