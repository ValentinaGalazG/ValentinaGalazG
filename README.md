## Hi everyone 👋

<!-
**ValentinaGalazG/ValentinaGalazG** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌊🧠I'm Marine Biologist from the Andrés Bello University. Currently, I'm studying the PhD program of Biological Sciences, mention in Ecology, in the Pontifical Catoholic University of Chile.
- 🔭✨ I'm very interested in physical oceanography, climate change and Earth and planetary sciences 🌍.
- 🦦 The love of my life is my pretty little baby (🎶), ¡Buñuelo! (a ferret).
- 🎮 I usually spend my free time gaming shooters: Valorant, Pubg, Apex, etc :). (Ah, and I like to play League of Legends too 😭, unfortunately 💔).
- 📫 You can find me as "Valentina Antonella Galaz" in LinkedIn, and "Valentina A. Galaz-Guajardo" in ResearchGate.
