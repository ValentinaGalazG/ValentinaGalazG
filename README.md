🔭🧠 I'm very interested in physical oceanography, climate change and Earth and Planetary sciences 🌍✨.

🦦 The love of my life is my pretty little baby (🎶), ¡Buñuelo! (a ferret 𖹭)

🎮 I usually spend my free time gaming shooters: Valorant, Pubg, Apex, etc :). (Ah, and I like to play League of Legends too 😭, unfortunately 💔).
